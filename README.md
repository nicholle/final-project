# final-project-description

I based my final project on Casper the ghost.  I wanted to explore more CSS3 animations in my project and set out to animate a cartoon character.  I decided on Casper because I thought it would make more sense to have a ghost fly around or float on the page. 

For my graphics, I used SVG as my main images (Casper, lightbulb and fatso) and used a haunted hallway picture as my background.  I thought about using a fog-like effect when we explored atmospheric elements in WebGl.  Instead, I used photoshop to create a second layer and played around with opacity, saturation and hue to create the effect.

I started with some basic animations. The first one being the ghost floating and the shadow shrinking simultaneously.  The more complex animations involved a combination of translating, rotations, scaling in the X,Y axis to create the various effects.  I used javascript to randomly generate a number between (0-5) and I numbered each of the animations.  When the user clicks on the lightbulb, a number is called and the animation changes at random.  

I hid a button on the top left corner (fatso, a ghost in the cartoon) which leads the user to a simpler page.  This page consists of Casper and five buttons where the user can click and see what the individual animations are without randomly toggling between the animations on the main page.
